personal trainer certification industry since its establishment in 1982. This capstone project aims to 
enhance the C.O.R.F.I.T. program by developing a state-of-the-art React-based bodybuilding application. 
The application, named C.O.R.F.I.T., will provide students and trainees with an innovative platform to 
access fitness resources and strengthen their knowledge. This project aligns with C.O.R.F.I.T.'s mission to 
provide the best education to aspiring personal trainers and bodybuilding enthusiasts.
